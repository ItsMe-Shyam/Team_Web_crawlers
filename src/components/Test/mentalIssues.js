      "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can happen after a person experiences a traumatic event, causing them to feel fearful, shocked, or helpless. It can have long-term effects, including flashbacks, difficulty sleeping, and anxiety.",
    solution:
      'To overcome post traumatic stress disorder, one must develop a strong sense of detachment and cultivate positivity in life. One should focus on the present moment and not let the past events affect them. As it is said in Bhagavad Gita, "One who restrains his senses and fixes his consciousness upon Me(To krishna) is known as a man of steady intelligence" (BG 2.61). It is also important to engage in selfless service, yoga and meditation to calm the mind and bring peace within. "Yoga is the journey of the self, through the self, to the self" (BG 6.39). Remember, nothing in this world is permanent and everything is temporary. So, do not hold onto the memories which cause pain and only bring sadness. Focus on the blessings in life and be grateful for them. By doing so, one can overcome any trauma and live a peaceful life.',

Approximately 2% of the population have OCD. Having OCD can significantly affect a person’s quality of life and their well-being.",

      solution:
      'According to Geeta , the root cause of all suffering is the attachment to the material world. Schizophrenia is a result of the imbalance of the mind caused by attachment and ignorance.

Surrender all your actions and emotions to me and offer them to me as an act of devotion. This will help you to attain mental peace and balance. In Chapter 12, verse 8 of the Bhagavad Gita, it is said, "Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer service to Me, bow down to Me, and you shall certainly reach Me. This is my firm promise."

As stated in the Gita, “Do everything you have to do, but not with greed, not with ego, not with attachment, not with lust, not with envy, but with love, compassion, humility, and devotion” (BG 9.27). By cultivating detachment and practicing these techniques, one can gradually overcome the ego and experience inner peace and freedom.
